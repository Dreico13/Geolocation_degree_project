# Geolocation_degree_project

In this project, I created a mini geolocation app to demonstrate the geolocation API of JavaScript and how to send the data to a PHP backend and save it to a MSSQL database.

The peculiarity of this application is that it only allows one user to utilize it, as it lacks registration, login, or logout options.

You can see the structure schema in the following image:
